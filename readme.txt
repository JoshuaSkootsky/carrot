    transcript

    [Ponytail sitting at a computer with Cueball standing behind her.]
    Cueball: When a user takes a photo,
    the app should check whether they're in a national park...
    Ponytail: Sure, easy GIS lookup. Gimme a few hours.
    Cueball: ...and check whether the photo is of a bird.
    Ponytail: I'll need a research team and five years.
    In CS, it can be hard to explain the difference between the easy
    and the virtually impossible.
